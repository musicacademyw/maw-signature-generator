# Music Academy of the West Email Signature Generator

Used to generate email signatures for Music Academy of the West employees.

## Building and Running

This is a static Svelte site, so it can be built and run with the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server that will reload the page when changes are made to the source files.

To build the site for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the built site.

The project was initialized using `npm init vite@latest` and selecting the Svelte template.
